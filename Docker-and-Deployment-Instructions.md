## Docker and Deployment Instructions

### Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project directory:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the FastAPI server
CMD ["uvicorn", "fastapi-server:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage the services:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
```

### Building and Running the Docker Container

1. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

### Deployment

To deploy the application, you can use a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Here are the general steps:

1. **Push the Docker image to a container registry:**

    ```sh
    docker tag <your_image> <your_registry>/<your_image>
    docker push <your_registry>/<your_image>
    ```

2. **Deploy the Docker container on a cloud service:**

    - **AWS:** Use Amazon ECS or EKS.
    - **Google Cloud:** Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Cloud Run.
    - **Azure:** Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service.

3. **Configure the service to expose port 8000 and set up any necessary environment variables.**

4. **Access the application via the provided URL from the cloud service.**

By following these instructions, you can containerize and deploy your FastAPI and Streamlit application using Docker.
